# LetterWordCounter

3rd project at the IronYard. Simple letter counter- you can tell I'm still learning both ruby and to think like a programmer. I had some trouble with some of the sorting, but completed it in the end.  Also, some good teamwork on this one as far as sharing of insights and parts different classmates figured out at different times.  Yay for shared success.
